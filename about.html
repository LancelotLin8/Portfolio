      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Born and raised in China, my family and I moved to southern California
        when I was 13 years old, throughout my childhood, I have always been fascinated with video games and how they work in the background, so in high school, i took all of the avaliable computer science classes. In college, I continue to study more and more about computer science and skills that is needed for jobs in the future. Currently I am working on doing Leetcode and writing interesting projects. In my free time, I like to play video games, go on road trips and have good food with friends.
